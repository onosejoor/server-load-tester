# 🚀 Blazing Fast Server Load Tester 🚀

A lightweight and efficient Go application to simulate user traffic and measure your server's performance. Get insights into response times, success rates, and potential bottlenecks with this simple yet powerful tool! ⚡️

## Usage

This tool is a command-line application. Here's how to use it:

```bash
go run main.go <url> [number_of_users]
```

*   `<url>`: The URL of the endpoint you want to test.
*   `[number_of_users]`: (Optional) The number of concurrent users to simulate. Defaults to 1.

### Examples

1.  **Basic Usage:** Test the URL `https://example.com` with 1 user.

    ```bash
    go run main.go https://example.com
    ```
2.  **Simulating Multiple Users:** Test the URL `https://example.com/api` with 100 concurrent users.

    ```bash
    go run main.go https://example.com/api 100
    ```

### Output

The application will print real-time results for each request, including success status, elapsed time, and HTTP status code. At the end of the test, it will provide a summary of total requests, successes, and failures.

```
{Success:true Elapsed:200ms Status:200}
{Success:false Elapsed:150ms Status:0}
...
✅ Program finished in 10s
🔁 Total requests: 100, ✅ Successes: 95, ❌ Failures: 5
```

## Features

*   ⚡️ **Concurrency**: Simulate multiple users with goroutines for realistic load testing.
*   ⏱️ **Timing**: Measure the elapsed time for each request to identify slow endpoints.
*   📊 **Reporting**: Get a summary of success and failure rates to evaluate server stability.
*   ✅ **JSON Parsing**: Attempts to decode the JSON response body and reports any errors during the process.
*   🌐 **Customizable**: Set the number of users and target URL via command-line arguments.
*   ⏱️ **Timeout**: Configurable timeout to prevent hanging requests.
